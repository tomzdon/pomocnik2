 2. **Offline usage**
		This application pre-caches static assets. Enter a valid Github handler,  (error handling in progress) the repositories of the user will be displayed. now, go offline and close the application and re-open the application. Enter the same handler used before, the cached response is shown. This can be tested by creating a new repository in the github. the newly created repository will not be displayed in the PWA application because it serves cached response.
